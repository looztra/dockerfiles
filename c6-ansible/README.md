What?
=====

The awesome folks at Ansible do not provide an [official image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/ansible/) for centos6, but it can sometime be usefull.

How?
====

* This image is built using the ansible version available in epel.
* If you need examples on how to use ansible in a Dockerfile, you can search on your favorite search engine or have a look at my [dockerfiles](https://github.com/looztra/dockerfiles)
